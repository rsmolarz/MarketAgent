# GreatestTradeAgent Module

This module implements an AI agent inspired by *The Greatest Trade Ever*.
It detects macroeconomic bubbles, CDS pricing inefficiencies, and structured product risks.

## Structure

- `macro_bubble_detector.py`: Detects housing/credit bubbles using price-to-income ratios, credit growth, etc.
- `cds_analyzer.py`: Evaluates CDS pricing relative to expected loss, flags under/overpriced contracts.
- `structured_product_analyzer.py`: Assesses tranche risk under different default correlation scenarios.
- `greatest_trade_agent.py`: Orchestrates the above modules and produces trading signals.

## Usage

```bash
# Example usage
python example_usage.py
```

The `example_usage.py` file shows how to run the agent end-to-end.

## Integration

1. Copy these files into your `MarketAgent` repo under a suitable folder (e.g. `agents/`).
2. Update `macro_bubble_detector.py` to fetch real economic data (from APIs like FRED).
3. Update `cds_analyzer.py` to use real CDS spread data from a market data provider.
4. Use `greatest_trade_agent.py` in your main pipeline or register it as a LangChain tool if needed.
5. Optionally connect an execution hook to trigger alerts or trades when conditions are met.

## Tests

See `tests/` folder for simple unit tests for each module.
