Part B — 1️⃣ Distressed Pricing Bands + Recovery Modeling
Model Output (stored per Deal)
class DealValuation(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "deal_valuation"

    deal_id = mapped_column(Integer, db.ForeignKey("deals.id"), primary_key=True)

    zestimate = mapped_column(Float)
    rent_zestimate = mapped_column(Float)

    distressed_price = mapped_column(Float)
    recovery_value = mapped_column(Float)

    discount_to_zestimate = mapped_column(Float)
    recovery_multiple = mapped_column(Float)

    confidence = mapped_column(Float)

Pricing Bands Logic
distressed_price = zestimate * 0.55 – 0.75
recovery_value = zestimate * 0.90 – 1.05

Recovery Score
recovery_multiple = recovery_value / distressed_price


Displayed on dashboard as:

Zestimate: $420k
Target Entry: $265k
Recovery: $395k
Gross Multiple: 1.49x

Part C — 2️⃣ IC Vote Tracking (Human vs AI)

This is non-optional if you want institutional credibility.

Model
class ICVote(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "ic_votes"

    id = mapped_column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    deal_id = mapped_column(Integer, index=True)

    voter = mapped_column(String(64))
    vote = mapped_column(String(16))  # ACT / WATCH / PASS
    notes = mapped_column(Text)

    is_override = mapped_column(Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = mapped_column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

Rules

AI ACT → suggests UNDERWRITING

Human PASS → forces PASSED

Human ACT overrides AI WATCH

Dashboard shows:

AI: ACT (82%)
IC: ACT (3/4)
Override: No

Part D — 3️⃣ Portfolio-Level Exposure by Deal Stage
Query
SELECT stage, COUNT(*) AS deals
FROM deals
GROUP BY stage;

Dashboard Card
SCREENED: 14
UNDERWRITING: 6
LOI: 2
CLOSED: 1
PASSED: 9

Capital Exposure Overlay
exposure = {
    "UNDERWRITING": 0.3,
    "LOI": 0.6,
    "CLOSED": 1.0
}


Used later for drawdown governor.

Part E — 4️⃣ Automated Deal Kill Rules (Critical)

This protects you from zombie deals.

Kill Conditions
Condition	Action
No IC activity in 14 days	Auto-PASS
Underwriting > 30 days	Flag
LOI unsigned > 21 days	PASS
Missing docs	PASS
Market regime flips risk-off	Freeze
Kill Engine (cron-safe)
if deal.stage == "UNDERWRITING" and age_days > 30:
    deal.stage = "PASSED"
    deal.kill_reason = "timeout"


Logged for audit.

How This All Connects (End-to-End)
Agent → Finding
Finding → IC Memo
IC ACT → Deal created
Zillow → Pricing bands
TA + LLM → Confidence
IC Votes → Override logic
Deal Stage → Exposure
Kill Rules → Capital discipline


You are now building a distressed-asset operating system, not a dashboard.
