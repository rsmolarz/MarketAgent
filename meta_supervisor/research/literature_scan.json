        "title": "Explainable Patterns in Cryptocurrency Microstructure",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00776v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The study identifies stable cross-asset patterns in cryptocurrency limit-order-book microstructure, suggesting the potential for a universal feature library for crypto markets. This could lead to more robust trading strategies across different cryptocurrencies, especially during market distress events like flash crashes."

        "title": "A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172v2",
        "why_it_matters": "The paper proposes a microstructural model that reconciles empirical properties like persistent signed order flow and rough volatility. This model could enhance understanding of market dynamics and improve prediction of market impact, offering a potential edge in high-frequency trading."

        "title": "Generative AI for Stock Selection",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00196v1",
        "why_it_matters": "This research demonstrates that generative AI can automate feature discovery in stock selection, potentially reducing manual effort and improving prediction accuracy. The AI-generated features show weak correlation with traditional features, suggesting new dimensions for alpha generation."
