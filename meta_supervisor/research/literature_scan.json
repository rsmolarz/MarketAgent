        "title": "Trading Electrons: Predicting DART Spread Spikes in ISO Electricity Markets",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05085v1",
        "why_it_matters": "This study introduces a structural and market-consistent price impact model for electricity markets, which can significantly improve the risk-return profile by capturing asymmetric buy/sell impacts and cross-zone congestion effects. It highlights substantial heterogeneity across markets and seasons, offering a potential edge in trading strategies."

        "title": "Intraday Limit Order Price Change Transition Dynamics Across Market Capitalizations Through Markov Analysis",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04959v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The research provides insights into the intraday transition dynamics of limit order prices across different market capitalizations, revealing systematic patterns and capitalization gradients. This can inform the design of capitalization-aware and time-adaptive execution algorithms, potentially improving trading efficiency."

        "title": "Forecasting Equity Correlations with Hybrid Transformer Graph Neural Network",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04602v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The paper presents a novel approach to forecasting stock correlations using a hybrid model that combines temporal and graph-based methods. This can enhance basket trading strategies, especially during market stress, by providing more accurate and adaptable correlation forecasts."
