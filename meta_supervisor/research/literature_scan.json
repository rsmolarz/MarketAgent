        "why_it_matters": "This research highlights the role of transaction fees in decentralized finance (DeFi) as a mechanism to prevent predatory price manipulations and improve the security of lending protocols. Understanding these dynamics can lead to better strategies for trading and risk management in DeFi markets."
