        "title": "Explainable Patterns in Cryptocurrency Microstructure",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00776v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The study identifies stable cross-asset patterns in cryptocurrency limit-order-book microstructure, suggesting a portable microstructure representation of short-horizon returns. This could lead to the development of universal feature libraries for crypto markets, enhancing trading strategies."

        "title": "Generative AI for Stock Selection",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00196v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The research demonstrates that generative AI can automate feature discovery in U.S. equities, providing economically motivated features that improve Sharpe ratios. This suggests potential for AI-driven stock selection strategies that reduce manual feature engineering."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172v2",
        "why_it_matters": "The paper presents a microstructural model that reconciles empirical properties of financial markets, such as persistent signed order flow and power-law market impact. This could inform the development of more accurate trading algorithms."
