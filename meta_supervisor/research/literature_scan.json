        "title": "Liquidation Dynamics in DeFi and the Role of Transaction Fees",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12104v1",
        "why_it_matters": "This research highlights the importance of transaction fees in decentralized finance (DeFi) as a mechanism to prevent predatory price manipulations and enhance the security of Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) oracles. Understanding these dynamics can lead to better strategies for managing liquidation risks and optimizing transaction fees."
