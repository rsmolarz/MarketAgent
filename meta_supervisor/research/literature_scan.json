        "title": "Integrating granular data into a multilayer network: an interbank model of the euro area for systemic risk assessment",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10960v1",
        "why_it_matters": "This research provides a comprehensive framework for assessing systemic risk in the euro area banking sector by integrating multiple layers of financial exposure data. It highlights the importance of considering cross-layer heterogeneity in connectivity and centrality, which can reveal systemic vulnerabilities that are not apparent in aggregated models."

        "title": "Trading in CEXs and DEXs with Priority Fees and Stochastic Delays",
        "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10798v1",
        "why_it_matters": "The study introduces a novel mixed control framework for optimizing trading strategies across centralized and decentralized exchanges, considering the trade-off between execution delays, uncertainty, and costs. This approach could significantly enhance trading efficiency and profitability in volatile markets."
