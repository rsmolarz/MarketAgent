Without a regime fit, it cannot dynamically adapt to varying market conditions, which limits its immediate applicability.\n\n## Edge Hypothesis\nNo explicit edge hypothesis is provided. Since the strategy field is empty, the agent does not currently articulate a unique source of alpha or market inefficiency it aims to exploit.\n\n## Key Signals\nThere are no key signals specified in the JSON. The absence of signals means the agent does not generate actionable insights or trades at this stage.\n\n## Risks\n- **Undefined Strategy**: Without a clear strategy, the agent poses operational risk due to lack of direction.\n- **No Regime Adaptation**: The empty regime trigger means it may perform poorly in volatile or shifting market environments.\n- **Zero Performance Metrics**: The fleet metrics (PnL, hit rate, drawdown, Sharpe) are all zero, indicating no historical or simulated performance data to assess risk or reward.\n- **No Recent Decisions**: The absence of promote or kill signals suggests no recent validation or rejection, increasing uncertainty.\n\n## Complementarity with Existing Agents\nGiven the lack of defined strategy and signals, this agent currently does not complement existing agents. It neither overlaps nor diversifies the fleet\u2019s exposure or methodologies.\n\n## Evaluation Plan\nTo move forward, the following evaluation steps are recommended:\n1. **Define Strategy and Regime Trigger**: Specify the trading logic and market conditions under which the agent operates.\n2. **Backtest and Simulate**: Generate historical performance metrics to populate the fleet data fields.\n3. **Signal Validation**: Identify and test key signals for predictive power and robustness.\n4. **Risk Assessment**: Quantify drawdowns, volatility, and tail risks.\n5. **Integration Testing**: Evaluate how the agent\u2019s signals interact with existing agents to assess complementarity.\n6. **Decision Tracking**: Establish criteria for promote/kill decisions based on performance and risk metrics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe \"manual\" agent is currently a placeholder with no defined strategy, regime fit, or signals. It requires substantial development and validation before it can be considered a viable addition to the fleet. The evaluation plan focuses on defining its core components and rigorously testing its performance and risk profile.\n```"
