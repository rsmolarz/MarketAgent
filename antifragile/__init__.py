Antifragile Board of Advisors

A multi-agent AI framework for radical risk management and systematic
alpha extraction, structured as a cognitive "Barbell" that balances
tail-risk specialists with quantitative researchers.

Architecture:
    - Taleb Agent: Epistemologist of Risk (fragility detection, Black Swan identification)
    - Spitznagel Agent: Safe Haven Practitioner (convexity, geometric returns, drawdown protection)
    - Simons Agent: High-Frequency Quant (pattern recognition, statistical anomalies)
    - Asness Agent: Disciplined Contrarian (Value/Momentum factors, behavioral bias exploitation)
    - Chairman: Synthesis agent that resolves conflicts via Council Protocol
